          <h3>Renaissance Learning</h3>
          <h4>Software Engineer I</h4>
          <p>
            I was a developer at one of Renaissance's engineering teams that's
            responsible for maintaining and developing new features for the
            assessment products.
            <br />
            <br />
            While there were a lot of incredible stories I got to work on at
            Renaissance, the ones that I feel I have provided the organization
            value with sustainable value are:
            <br />
            <ul class="accomplishments">
              <li>
                Leading the creation of assessment applications in our new micro front end
                architecture, which renders Desmos and Casio authored items in addition to
                Renaissance items within a single assessment framework to meet educational
                standards for the state of Indiana.
              </li>
              <li>
                Creating new simulation and performance tests using Selenium and Jmeter to
                simulate student journeys through our assessment products.
              </li>
              <li>
                Creating new API gateways using AWS lambdas for creating new assessments in
                our latest workflows.
              </li>
              <li>
                Created new tabular page views for our Benchmark UI, along with new data
                endpoints that support this view using ASP.NET MVC frameworks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Creating a new liliary specific to Renaissance's angular components to
                facilitate SAML hops across the entire platform without any loss of
                contextual data between applications.
              </li>
              <li>
                Creating new data endpoints in GraphQL to consolidate the different calls we

                I proposed an initiative for digitizing and distributing K-12 curriculum for the state of Kerela, seeing as they had recently achieved the milestone of providing internet access for all of their citizens.  
                I won two awards, one for the best written proposal, the other was an honorary mention from the current government for the proposal's feasibility and speed of implementation. 
                The proposal was then sent to the Kerelan Ministry of Education for further consideration.
