                        I am interested in developing systems and platforms that enable educators and industry practicioners to teach their students and employees using the latest innovations in Educational Technology. I am a passionate developer with over 3 years of experience in Software and Web Development. 
                        When I am not developing websites or tools, you will probably find me in an Art Museum or exploring nature.

                    As part of my Capstone Project, I am Working alongside K12, one of America's largest online schools to develop an online tool that improves facilitation for students aiming to execute Project Based Learning in a collaborative environment. Refined and ideated several suggestions to the client based on research principles founded in learning science. I will be developing some of these ideas as functional prototypes so that they can implement the same in their site.

                <p>
                    After my research project on facial detection systems on low-end kiosks, I was contacted by NIIT Foundation to develop a similar tool with linguistic support for the TED Prize winning project - Hole in the Wall. Over the course of several months, I worked remotely with my client, ideated several prototypes and suggestions for implementing this technology in remote locations. The tool was developed in Python and OpenCV and is currently being integrated into their platform and will be deployed over 200 kiosks.

                <p>
					At Collarfolk, I was brought in initially to implement a fully functional E-Commerce platform on Collarfolk’s website
					using Woocommerce. In addition to developing this sub-website, I incorporated additional custom functionality to handle inventory management and customer notification systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was then consulted again on ways to boost traffic to the website.
					Therefore, I handled On-Page SEO and monitored page activity on Google Analytics. 
					Certain pages on the website were increasing the latency delay by about a minute. In addition, photos were not being minified for thumbnails.
					Therefore, I reduced the latency by 50% (4.6s - 2.3s) on the homepage and boosted incoming
					traffic by 30% in the following month.
				</p>
				<p>
					I designed a new layout to mirror standard industry practices for searches in the Holiday domain and took charge of handling creative content on fourfronts for Social Media and Fundraising purposes.

Members of the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh community, including patients, families, physicians and nurses, presented 11 problems as <a href = "https://www.givetochildrens.org/hackthishelpkids/painpoints">pain points</a>, with topics ranging from following proper medicine schedules to deciphering asthma demographics.

                            Our team designed a low cost prototype for monitoring the expiry and temperature of breast milk. I was in charge of User Experience and I contributed to the web prototpye in addition to the pitch deck presented to the clients.
